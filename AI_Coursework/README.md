A mostly complete example of a Genetic Algorithm optimised for continous problems. Implemented various crossover, selection and mutation methods:

Selection:
  - Roulette Style
  - Steady State Selection

Mutation:
  - Single gene mutation
  - Multi gene mutation

Crossover:
  - Middle point crossover
  - Multi point crossover

Various continuous optimisation problems were implemented:
  1. Sum square problem
  2. Weighted Input Problem
  3. Levy Function
  4. Trid Function
  5. Griewank Function
  6. Zakharov Function

A very bare bone test bench has been implemented, that allows for multiple GA runs, and their results to be displayed as a couple of graphs.

Written in Python 3.8.7, uses Numpy 1.19.2 and Matplotlib 3.3.2
