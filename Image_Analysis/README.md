Implement our own compression techniques.
Due to this being a group coursework, I just uploaded the files of the code I used and submitted.

Manual implementations of both Discrete Cosine Transform, and Huffman Encoding in MATLAB.

Some images were provided for the coursework, however these haven't been included.
