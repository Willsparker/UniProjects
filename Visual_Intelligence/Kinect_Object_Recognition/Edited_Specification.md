## CS3VI18 Kinect Based Object Recognition

### Description: 

The purpose of this assignment is to implement an object recognition method in
Python or C/C++ to recognise different objects. Please consult your lecture notes for
an overview of object recognition approaches, as well material from the literature.
Methods may include geometric (shape) analysis and appearance-based methods. You
are provided with a framework to install and use which provides access to Kinect data
(see below). You may wish to use OpenCV (opencv.org), a library of programming
functions, for real time computer vision. However, bear in mind that your own
successful implementation of recognition will attract more marks than using library
functions alone (although you may wish to use some of the OpenCV functions to
support your implementation.)


The basic requirement is to be able to recognise different objects, presented as
streamed depth data from a Microsoft Kinect sensor (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) To give you an idea of whatis expected, consult
the following video: http://tinyurl.com/2u9pkym You may optionally use RGB (colour)
information in your object recognition process.


Note: you are not expected to generate a program that learns objects on the fly. All
objects can be learnt offline. Your overall solution should include (1) implementation
of an appropriate recognition algorithm; (2) performance evaluation of the recognition
algorithm on the test dataset using a confusion matrix.
